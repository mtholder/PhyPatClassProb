\vskip 0.2em
A wide variety of evolutionary analyses are based upon the pairing of phylogenetic trees with models of how evolution affects biological traits over time.  It is necessary in some contexts to calculate the probability of observing any member of a class of patterns arising on the tree, as exemplified in research conducted by Waddell et al. (2009) and Lewis (2001).  In the Waddell et al. (2009) model adequacy approach, calculating the probability of several classes of patterns is required.  Calculating the probability of any parsimony-informative pattern arising is also required in order to extend Lewis's (2001) morphological models to handle several datasets ('parsimony' referring to the simplest explanation of the data, and 'parsimony-informative' referring to those patterns which affect phylogenetic estimation).  
\vskip 0.67em
We recently published an algorithm that includes a general approach applicable to any standard model of character evolution.  We performed run-time performance tests and validated our results against Waddell's simulations, and have recently been developing efficient, dynamic programming algorithms which calculate the probabilities of a parsimony-uninformative pattern in one pass down a tree.  We are currently running our algorithms through PAUP, a widely-used software package for inferring phylogenies, to ensure they are accurate. After testing our algorithms on several datasets and polishing our code to ensure it is optimally efficient, we will draft a second article for publication. \vskip 0 em{\color{boxcolor}.}

The model adequacy assessment \citep{WaddellOP2009} and the extension of Lewis's \citep{Lewis2001} model both entail calculations based on classes of patterns that share the same parsimony length on a tree.
The model adequacy test also requires partitioning patterns based on the set of states observed at the tree's leaves.
%Fitch \citep{Fitch1971} provided an efficient algorithm for calculating the parsimony score.

%The Fitch algorithm can calculate the parsimony length for a tree rooted at an internal node from a ``downpass state set'' for the children of the node.
We have developed a dynamic programming algorithm that can calculate the probability of classes of patterns that share the same set of observed states and parsimony length on a tree. For a tree of $N$ leaves, the algorithm requires storing bins of probability for:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item each of the $N-1$ internal nodes,
	\item each of the $\approx N - 1$ parsimony lengths,
	\item each of the $k$ ancestral states,
	\item  each of the $2^{k}-1$ observed state sets, and
	\item each of the $2^{k}-1$ downpass state sets in Fitch's \cite{Fitch1971} algorithm.
\end{compactitem}
yielding an approximate memory requirement of $\mathcal{O}(N^2 k 2^{2k}$).
$k$ is bounded and often small ($k=4$ for DNA data).
With respect to tree size, calculations scale $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ (see Figure \ref{Log2RunTimeGraph})
Waddell {\em et al.~}\citep{WaddellOP2009} used simulation on a tree of mammals to obtain probabilities for classes of patterns.
We validated our algorithm with the same data and confirmed very similar probability calculations (Figure \ref{ComparisonToWaddell}).  
These results were presented in our recently published article in the PloS Currents Tree of Life online journal\cite{KochH2012}.

\vskip .02em \large \textbf{Specialization for Parsimony-Uninformative Patterns}\normalsize\\
\vskip .1em
For decades, the parsimony method was the dominant means of inferring phylogenies from
morphological data. 
So, many datasets describing organisms' morphological traits only contain parsimony-informative patterns.
Correcting for this data filtering to only include parsimony informative patterns
is crucial to reliable tree inference \cite{NylanderRHN2004,AllmanHR2010}.
To correct the calculations, one must be able to calculate the probability of 
generating a parsimony uninformative pattern.

We are in the last stages of developing a specialization of the algorithm for calculating the class of parsimony uninformative patterns.
By definition, a parsimony informative pattern will a length of $k-1$, thus we do not need to keep probabilities
for an array of tree lengths.
We can also ignore the $\mathcal{O}(2^{k}$) downpass states, in order to record which of the $k$ states is repeated in the tree (there can only be one). 
\vskip 1.84em
Thus the specialization should have memory requirements that scale as $\mathcal{O}(N k^2 2^{k}$).
The need to consider multiple parsimony lengths as well as consider all possible ways of partitioning this length between the left and right subtrees are responsible for $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ of the running time of the general algorithm.
Thus, we expect the specialized form to run in an amount of time that is linear with the number of leaves in the tree.

%In these models, many calculations return the same answer. (Knowing that distinct combinations give the same result allows the answer to be calculated with fewer operations). 
%We can sketch out a rough computational complexity for a symmetric version of the algorithm.
%We can focus on the size of these sets, since the exact nature of the state sets are not relevant here.  
%There are only $k$ distinct sizes (from $1$ to $k$) rather than $2^{k}-1$ state sets.
%This allows for drastic improvement and simplification in the algorithm.\\
%{\bf Figure \ref{ComparisonToWaddell}} is a comparison of the expected number of sites in varying pattern classes for a tree of 730-base RAG1 sequences from 40 species of mammals.  This shows the expected number of sites obtained from Waddell's simulations, compared to the calculations returned by our algorithm.  The pattern class probabilities were estimated by calculating the patterns' relative frequency based on 100,000 simulated sites.  The tree, model, and all data are identical to those used by Waddell et al.
%shows a graph representing the calculations required for 
%a scenario in which an internal node has the down pass state set of $\{0\}$.
%Under a fully symmetric model, the state sets of the same size (e.g. $\{0,1\}$ and $\{0,2\}$) will imply the same probabilities.
%While there are 9 combinations of states sets, there are only 6 combinations of state set sizes.
%The time savings for this model expand for larger values of $k$.
%A symmetric model specialization will enable considerations of characters with many states.
%There are (n-1) internal nodes in a tree, which increases by a factor of one with each additional leaf on the tree.  (This is scaled linearly).  We must sweep over all the possible parsimony lengths under that, which are equal to [1-(the number of leaves at that point)].  Therefore, at each child we will need to calculate for 0 and 1, whereas at the ancestor we will need to calculate for 0, 1, 2 and 3.  But as the tree becomes very large, the number of calculations / the number of length bins will be approximately of the order n.\\
